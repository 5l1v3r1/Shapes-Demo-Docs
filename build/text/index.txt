eProsima Shape Demo
*******************

Shapes Demo is an application that Publishes and Subscribes to shapes
of different colors and sizes moving on a board. Each Shape conforms
its own topic: Square, Triangle or Circle. A single instance of the
Shapes Demo can publish on or subscribe to several topics at a time.

It can be used to demonstrate the capabilities of eProsima Fast RTPS
or as an interoperability demonstrator with other implementations of
the RTPS protocol.
